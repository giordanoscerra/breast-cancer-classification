!Series_summary	"Breast cancer is one of the deadly tumors in women, and its incidence continues to increase. This study aimed to identify novel therapeutic molecules using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data of breast cancer from our hospitals."
!Series_overall_design	"30 pairs of normal and cancerous tissues from the same excision were collected from the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Guangzhou Army General Hospital. RNA sequencing was performed by Guangzhou Huayin Health medical Group. Original reads of RNA sequencing data were normalized as FPKM data."

Subsequently, mRNA fragment was interrupted using VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, cat.NR604, Nanjing, China) under 94℃ 8min and reversed transcription into cDNA which would use to synthesise U-labeled second-stranded DNAs. An A-base was added to the blunt ends of each strand to ligase the indexed adapters which contains a T-base at the tail end. After UDG enzyme treatment of the U-labeled double-strand DNA, size selection was performed with VAHTS DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, cat.N411, Nanjing, China). Then the ligated products are amplified with PCR by the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98℃ for 5 min; 12-17 cycles of denaturation at 98℃ for 10 sec, annealing at 60℃ for 30 sec, and extension at 72℃ for 30 sec; final extension at 72℃ for 5 min.

"After the quality inspection of Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, cat.G2939AA, CA, USA) and NanoPhotometer (Implen, cat.N60, Munich, Germany), mRNA with poly(A) is purified from 1μg total RNA using VAHTS mRNA Capture Beads with Oligo (dT) (Vazyme, cat.N401-01, Nanjing, China) through two rounds of purification.
